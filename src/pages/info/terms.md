### **2.2 Use of a Vehicle**

When the Rider just intends to rent a Vehicle, he has to choose the option “Reserve a bike”. A bike will remain Reserved for 20 minutes and will be available for the Rider for exclusive commencement of a Rental. If not taken up by the Rider during the Reserved 20 minute period, the bike will revert to the pool of available bikes for Rental in the eBike Hub.

A booking may consist of one Vehicle only and may only be made for the Rider.

The presentation of the clickable button “Select & Unlock Bike” is a legally binding offer from the Customer to the Rider to rent the Vehicle they selected in accordance with these Terms & Conditions and any additional terms, conditions and pricing shown in the App. 

By clicking the before mentioned button the Rider accepts this offer and the contract is concluded and the Rental starts immediately.

The current Rental fee will be displayed via the App during the Rental.

The Rider is entitled to cancel a booking at any time until the Vehicle is picked up and unlocked for the first time in a Rental. 

The Rental ends, when the Rider returns the Vehicle(s) to the Hub and pushes the button “Lock & End Ride” in the App, and completes the process until the end of the rental is confirmed in the App. Riders must physically lock the Vehicle as guided by the App using both the wheel lock and chain lock.

When the Rider locks the vehicle without being at a Hub and does not return the Vehicle to the Hub at the end of a ride, the Rider has to pay a relocation surcharge of:

* $250 if the Vehicle is within 5km of the applicable eBike Hub  
* $500 if the Vehicle is greater than 5km from the applicable eBike Hub

Before the Rider unlocks a bike for the first time in any Rental, the Rider can cancel the Rental through the “Cancel Reservation” button in the App. 

The Rider is fully responsible for their Vehicle at all times during the Rental period.

## **3\. Use of the Vehicles**

The Rider shall ensure that they are aware of and comply with these T\&Cs as well as all applicable national and state legislation on rules for bicycle riding.

The Vehicle is intended for a maximum weight of 100kg excluding cargo. Usage outside these ranges may increase risks of accidents or damage to the vehicle for which the Rider will be fully liable. Cargo is restricted to 8kg in each of any basket attached to the vehicle. Only one person is permitted on the Vehicle at any one time.

On the eBike Hub website, the Rider can access recommendations on how to check the condition of a Vehicle at the beginning of the Rental, and how to park the Vehicle after use to end the Rental at the eBike Hub.

If a Vehicle is not returned and parked accordingly, the Rider must pay the applicable relocation surcharge;  
* correctly locking the Vehicle at the eBike Hub. Detailed instructions for locking the Vehicle are described in the App and on the Website. These instructions are prompted by the Rider by pressing the “Lock & End Ride” button in the App;

## **4\. Defects and damages on the Vehicle**

Prior to the pickup by unlocking the Vehicle, the Rider shall examine the Vehicle to identify any visible defects or damages, including but not limited to tyres and lights, and brakes, seat, handlebar as applicable.

### **5.1 Missing Vehicle**

Liability in case of theft / disappearance – no agreed limitation. 

If the Rider has not locked the vehicle with the E-lock in the case of disappearance, the Rider will be notified of the claim of disappearance or theft and given 48 hours to respond. If the Rider does not respond, the rented Vehicle will – unless found in good working order – be regarded as lost or stolen and the Rider is liable hereof. When the Vehicle has been missing for 7 days, the Customer(s) has the right to charge the Rider the following amounts in order to compensate the Supplier(s):

If the Vehicle is recovered after more than 90 days after the Vehicle is reported missing, Rider will not be refunded.

The Rider is expressly permitted to prove that a financial harm or impairment did not occur at all, or the financial harm or impairment is significantly lower than the aforementioned lump sums. When the Supplier(s) can confirm that the vehicles were locked when stolen the Rider will not be held accountable for the missing of the vehicle and therefore will not be charged any additional fees. In this instance, the Customer(s) will be liable for the compensation amount agreed with the Supplier(s).
