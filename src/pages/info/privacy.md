## **Location data**

If necessary, we may collect your location data (GPS). If that is the case, you will be asked to grant consent beforehand. This location data and other data can also be stored and processed by the provider of the navigation/mapping software, such as Google Maps, but the data could also be used by, for example, Google or Apple itself. We have no control over their actions. We recommend that you read the applicable privacy statement of the provider in question.

## **Providing data to third parties**

Except for the parties necessary to deliver the above-mentioned services, we do not under any circumstance provide your personal data to other companies or organisations, unless we are required to do so by law (for example, when the police demands access to personal data in case of a suspected crime). Our website features social media buttons. These buttons are used by the providers of these services to collect your personal data.

## **Statistics**

We keep statistics on the use of our app, and anonymised data on the use of the vehicles. 

## **Google Analytics**

We use Google Analytics to track visitors on our website and to get reports about how visitors use the website. We accepted the data processing agreement from Google. We donâ€™t allow Google to use information obtained by Analytics for other Google services, and we anonymize the IP-addresses.

## **Security**

We take security measures to reduce misuse of and unauthorized access to personal data. We take responsibility in the security of your personal data. We renew our security measures to ensure safe storage of personal data and keep track of what might go wrong.

## **Data protection officer**

We have appointed a so-called *data protection officer*. This person is responsible for privacy matters within our organisation. Our data protection officer is Chris Arnott and is available by email (chrisarnott@ridekola.com.au) for all your questions and requests.

## **Changes to this privacy statement**

We reserve the right to modify this statement. We recommend that you consult this statement on a regular basis, so that you remain informed of any changes.

## **Inspection and modification of your data**

This term can be extended if the request is proven to be complex or tied to a specific right. You will be notified about a possible extension of this term.
